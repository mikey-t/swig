## Async vs Sync Functions and Typescript Method Signatures

You can technically pass non-async functions to `series` and `parallel`, but it's not recommended - it may lead to subtle bugs, so just mark your functions with `async` even if there's nothing async happening. You will also notice that if you're using a typescript swigfile and you have type checking, it will complain about any functions not matching these types (you'll get an error like `Argument of type '() => void' is not assignable to parameter of type 'TaskOrNamedTask'`):

```Typescript
export type Task = () => Promise<any>
export type NamedTask = [string, Task]
```

More on `NamedTask` below under [Anonymous Functions and Named Anonymous Functions](#anonymous-functions-and-named-anonymous-functions).

## Individual Single Function Tasks

The `series` and `parallel` methods are really handy, but sometimes you may just want to run one single function, which you can do by simply exporting a regular function in your swigfile:

```JavaScript
export async function doStuff() {...}
```

Then run it with:
```JavaScript
// Global swig install
swig doStuff
// Local swig install
npx swig doStuff
```

## Anonymous Functions and Named Anonymous Functions

You can pass anonymous functions to `series` and `parallel`.

Example of using an anonymous function:

```javascript
async function doStuff() {
  console.log('log message from doStuff')
}

export const yourTask = series(
  doStuff,
  async () => { console.log('This is a console message from an anonymous task') }
)
```

```
[6:00:21 PM] Starting ðŸš€ doStuff
log message from doStuff
[6:00:21 PM] Finished âœ… doStuff after 9 ms
[6:00:21 PM] Starting ðŸš€ anonymous
This is a console message from an anonymous task
[6:00:21 PM] Finished âœ… anonymous after 1 ms
```

This is really handy if you have a library of helper methods that you want to easily be able to pass in as one-liners while using params from your script, all without re-defining new wrapper functions or creating factory functions. For example:

```javascript
import { syncEnvFiles, emptyDirectory, ensureDockerUp } from 'my-lib'

// Example script var
const dockerProjectName = '...'

// Example helper method/sub-task
async function runIntegrationTests() { /* ... */ }

// Export your task to be run by swig
export const build = series(
  parallel(
    async () => syncEnvFiles('.env', [clientDir, serverDir, dockerDir]),
    async () => emptyDirectory(clientBuildDir),
    async () => emptyDirectory(serverBuildDir)
  ),
  async () => ensureDockerUp(dockerProjectName),
  prepBuild,
  parallel(
    buildClient,
    buildServer
  ),
  parallel(
    async () => myLib.copyDirectory(clientBuildDir, clientReleaseDir),
    async () => myLib.copyDirectory(serverBuildDir, serverReleaseDir)
  ),
  runIntegrationTests
)
```

And if you don't want the output to log your methods as "`anonymous`" as shown further above, you can use a tuple with a label to use with your anonymous function (`NamedTask = [string, Task]`):

```javascript
export const build = series(
  prepBuild,
  parallel(buildClient, buildServer),
  ['copyClientBuild', async () => copyDirectory(clientBuildDir, clientReleaseDir)],
  ['copyServerBuild', async () => copyDirectory(serverBuildDir, serverReleaseDir)]
)
```
Example output with named anonymous tasks:
```
[6:09:26 PM] Starting ðŸš€ prepBuild
[6:09:26 PM] Finished âœ… prepBuild after 12 ms
[6:09:26 PM] Starting ðŸš€ nested_parallel_1
[6:09:26 PM] Starting ðŸš€ buildClient
[6:09:26 PM] Starting ðŸš€ buildServer
[6:09:26 PM] Finished âœ… buildClient after 0 ms
[6:09:26 PM] Finished âœ… buildServer after 1 ms
[6:09:26 PM] Finished âœ… nested_parallel_1 after 2 ms
[6:09:26 PM] Starting ðŸš€ copyClientBuild
[6:09:26 PM] Finished âœ… copyClientBuild after 1 ms
[6:09:26 PM] Starting ðŸš€ copyServerBuild
[6:09:26 PM] Finished âœ… copyServerBuild after 0 ms
```

Wow! Nice!

## Error Behavior

I've setup the default behavior to be fairly simple:

- If a function called by series throws an error, no further execution will occur
- If a function called by parallel throws an error:
  - All sibling functions within the same parallel call will be allowed to continue
  - All errors for all functions in the same parallel call that threw errors will have the error they threw logged to the console at the end of execution (in addition to whatever logging you have setup in the functions themselves)
  - Execution will stop after all methods in the same parallel call return

If you have more complicated error behavior requirements, there's lots of ways to do this with vanilla javascript, such as setting and checking global state vars in your swigfile. And if for some reason you've concocted some really complex error scenarios that requires finer grained control and you want it wired directly up to series/parallel methods... well then there's always gulp.

## Typescript Notes

For a typescript swigfile.ts to work, you need to install [ts-node](https://typestrong.org/ts-node/docs/) as a local dependency. Or alternatively you can use [tsx](https://github.com/esbuild-kit/tsx) (note that ESM functionality is currently advertised as being experimental, but it seems to work).

For ts-node, note that I'm using the `-T` option under the hood to speed up execution ([`--transpileOnly`](https://typestrong.org/ts-node/docs/options#transpileonly)). There's valid reasons not to use this, but I generally rely on the IDE along with plugins like eslint plugins to find "compile-time" errors when I'm using ts-node in a dev situation rather than slowing down the execution with these type of checks. And if you don't use a good IDE for some reason, you'll still get some of the errors - you'll just see them at a slightly different spot in the execution process. But there are plenty of scenarios where this will let you shoot yourself in the foot, so be aware if you're writing code in Notepad.exe or something. In the future I'd like to allow overriding swig's default ts-node config so this and other ts-node options can be changed.

If you don't want to install ts-node or want to do your own transpilation, you can have 2 swigfiles in your directory and it'll pick the first one it finds, starting with the non-typescript versions. So if you have `swigfile.ts` file and maybe you have it automatically being transpiled to `swigfile.js`, then swig will pick up and use the `swigfile.js` version instead of using ts-node. Don't forget to setup live watching of your swigfile if you're actively making changes and re-running it (such as with `tsc --watch` or whatever tool you're using).You wouldn't want to end up scratching your head because something isn't doing what you think it should, only because it doesn't have your latest changes.

## Recommended Usage

My recommendation is to install `swig-cli` as as global npm package (`npm i -g swig-cli`) because it will run much faster (no initial delay from npm/npx - see below), and you can type less. Also, if you use this on many projects like I do, you don't have to remember to add npm aliases to each project.

My opinion is that running stuff through npx and npm aliases is annoying because of the initial delay on each startup. For me this delay can be anywhere between 1 second and 4-8 seconds for some reason. That's not all that long, but it feels like an eternity when running a task that should only take a few milliseconds. This is why I prefer and recommend using a global install of `swig-cli` so you can call `swig` directly without incurring the startup delay.

## Using Npx

If you choose not to install `swig-cli` globally (see above) and don't want to use npm aliases (see below), then you simply prefix all your commands with `npx`:

```
npx swig yourTask
```

## Npm Aliases

This isn't the recommended approach, but if you choose to use npm aliases anyway, you could setup a single alias this this:

```json
"scripts": {
  "swig": "swig"
}
```

And then call it with :

```bash
npm run swig yourTask
```

Or if you really like npm aliases for each individual task, then you could do something like this:

```json
"scripts": {
  "swig": "swig",
  "build": "swig build",
  "test": "swig test"
}
```

So that you can run your tasks like this:

```
npm run build
npm run test
npm run swig someOtherTask
```

But just to re-iterate, using npm aliases isn't the recommended approach. The idea behind swig is to be able to run `swig` and quickly see all the available commands without even having to open the package.json file or experience the slowness of npm.

## Other Commands

Use the command `swig help` to see other available commands:

```
Usage: swig <command or taskName> [options]
Commands:
  <taskName> - Run a "task", which is an async function exported from your swigfile
    swig taskName
  list, ls, l - List available tasks (default)
    swig list
  help, h - Show help message
    swig help
  version, v - Print version number
    swig version
  filter, f - Filter and list tasks by name
    swig filter pattern
```

Note that these are essentially "reserved words". If you define exported tasks with these names in your swigfile, they'll never get run. The swig command will be run instead. Originally I was using dash params, but npm aliases and npx was causing them to be hijacked (for example, npx swig -v would output the npx version...). I've since changed my startup strategy and that may no longer be an issue, but I've left the commands as is for now.

Also note the `filter` command, which is handy if you have long list of commands and want to show only those with a particular substring (case insensitive). For example, list all tasks that have `db` in their names:

```bash
swig f db
```
