# swig

Swig is a simple CLI tool for automating dev workflows via compositions of series and parallel tasks.

## Why Swig Instead of Gulp?

Why recreate the series/parallel automation that Gulp already has? Gulp is great - I use it a lot. I have a handful of reasons for wanting to create swig, but I guess the main one is just to see if I could, and to have control to tweak things as I see fit. I rant about this quite a bit, but be warned that it's quite opinionated: [./docs/WhySwigInsteadOfGlup.md](./docs/WhySwigInsteadOfGlup.md).

## Getting Started

- (Optional, but recommended) Install swig (`swig-cli`) globally for convenient shortened commands and much faster task execution (no initial delay from npm/npx):

```bash
npm i -g swig-cli@latest
```

- Install `swig-cli` package as dev dependency so you can import `series` and `parallel`:

```bash
npm i -D swig-cli
```

- Create a `swigfile` in the root of your project, such as `swigfile.js` (see [Swigfile Syntax Options Matrix](#swigfile-syntax-options-matrix))
- Add some tasks to your swigfile. Any exported function will do, but the magic happens when you start composing functions together with `series` and `parallel` - see examples below.
- Add some tasks to your swigfile (see [Series, Parallel and Composability Examples](#series-parallel-and-composability-examples))
- List detected tasks from your swigfile:

```JavaScript
// Global install
swig
// Local install
npx swig
```

- Run a task:

```JavaScript
// Global install
swig yourTask
// Local install
npx swig yourTask
```

## Swigfile Syntax Options Matrix

Your `swigfile` can be one of the following:

- `swigfile.cjs`
- `swigfile.mjs`
- `swigfile.js`
- `swigfile.ts`

If there are multiple swigfiles in your project directory, swig will use the first one it finds, using the order above. The following shows the various options for your swigfile file extension, package.json `type` and syntax flavor to use.

| Swigfile Extension | package.json `type`  | Required Syntax           | Notes                               |
|--------------------|----------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `.js`              | `module`             | ESM Syntax                 |                                     |
| `.js`              | Not `module` (CommonJS)| CommonJS Syntax          |                                     |
| `.cjs`             | Any                  | CommonJS Syntax           | `package.json` type doesn't matter  |
| `.mjs`             | Any                  | ESM Syntax                 | `package.json` type doesn't matter  |
| `.ts`              | Any                  | Typescript Syntax         | `ts-node` must be installed as a local dependency|

## Series, Parallel and Composability Examples

A dev task like `build` might have several steps where some steps can happen in parallel and others must happen sequentially. So we define each of the steps as functions and compose them into an exported task we're calling simply `build`:

Sample swigfile contents:
```JavaScript
async function buildPrep() {...}
async function buildServer() {...}
async function buildClient() {...}
async function postBuild() {...}

export const build = series(buildPrep, parallel(buildClient, buildServer), postBuild)
```

And then we can run it with :
```javascript
// Global install
swig build
// Local install
npx swig build
```

## Async vs Sync Functions and Typescript Method Signatures

You can technically pass non-async functions to `series` and `parallel`, but it's not recommended - it may lead to subtle bugs, so just mark your functions with `async` even if there's no `await` being used. You will also notice that if you're using a typescript swigfile and you have type checking, it will complain about any functions not matching these types (you'll get an error like `Argument of type '() => void' is not assignable to parameter of type 'TaskOrNamedTask'`):

```Typescript
export type Task = () => Promise<any>
export type NamedTask = [string, Task]
```

More on `NamedTask` below under [Anonymous Functions and Named Anonymous Functions](#anonymous-functions-and-named-anonymous-functions).

## Individual Single Function Tasks

The `series` and `parallel` methods are really handy, but sometimes you may just want to run one single function, which you can do by simply exporting a regular function in your swigfile:

```JavaScript
export async function doStuff() {...}
```

Then run it with:
```JavaScript
// Global swig install
swig doStuff
// Local swig install
npx swig doStuff
```

## Anonymous Functions and Named Anonymous Functions

You can pass anonymous functions to `series` and `parallel`.

Example of using an anonymous function:

```javascript
async function doStuff() {
  console.log('log message from doStuff')
}

export const yourTask = series(
  doStuff,
  async () => { console.log('This is a console message from an anonymous task') }
)
```

```
[6:00:21 PM] Starting ðŸš€ doStuff
log message from doStuff
[6:00:21 PM] Finished âœ… doStuff after 9 ms
[6:00:21 PM] Starting ðŸš€ anonymous
This is a console message from an anonymous task
[6:00:21 PM] Finished âœ… anonymous after 1 ms
```

This is really handy if you have a library of helper methods that you want to easily be able to pass in as one-liners while using params from your script, all without re-defining new wrapper functions or creating factory functions. For example:

```javascript
import { syncEnvFiles, emptyDirectory, ensureDockerUp } from 'my-lib'

// Example script var
const dockerProjectName = '...'

// Example helper method/sub-task
async function runIntegrationTests() { /* ... */ }

// Export your task to be run by swig
export const build = series(
  parallel(
    async () => syncEnvFiles('.env', [clientDir, serverDir, dockerDir]),
    async () => emptyDirectory(clientBuildDir),
    async () => emptyDirectory(serverBuildDir)
  ),
  async () => ensureDockerUp(dockerProjectName),
  prepBuild,
  parallel(
    buildClient,
    buildServer
  ),
  parallel(
    async () => myLib.copyDirectory(clientBuildDir, clientReleaseDir),
    async () => myLib.copyDirectory(serverBuildDir, serverReleaseDir)
  ),
  runIntegrationTests
)
```

And if you don't want the output to log your methods as "`anonymous`" as shown further above, you can use a tuple with a label to use with your anonymous function (`NamedTask = [string, Task]`):

```javascript
export const build = series(
  prepBuild,
  parallel(buildClient, buildServer),
  ['copyClientBuild', async () => copyDirectory(clientBuildDir, clientReleaseDir)],
  ['copyServerBuild', async () => copyDirectory(serverBuildDir, serverReleaseDir)]
)
```
Example output with named anonymous tasks:
```
[6:09:26 PM] Starting ðŸš€ prepBuild
[6:09:26 PM] Finished âœ… prepBuild after 12 ms
[6:09:26 PM] Starting ðŸš€ nested_parallel_1
[6:09:26 PM] Starting ðŸš€ buildClient
[6:09:26 PM] Starting ðŸš€ buildServer
[6:09:26 PM] Finished âœ… buildClient after 0 ms
[6:09:26 PM] Finished âœ… buildServer after 1 ms
[6:09:26 PM] Finished âœ… nested_parallel_1 after 2 ms
[6:09:26 PM] Starting ðŸš€ copyClientBuild
[6:09:26 PM] Finished âœ… copyClientBuild after 1 ms
[6:09:26 PM] Starting ðŸš€ copyServerBuild
[6:09:26 PM] Finished âœ… copyServerBuild after 0 ms
```

Wow! Nice!

## Error Behavior

I've setup the default behavior to be fairly simple:

- If a function called by series throws an error, no further execution will occur
- If a function called by parallel throws an error:
  - All sibling functions within the same parallel call will be allowed to continue
  - All errors for all functions in the same parallel call that threw errors will have the error they threw logged to the console at the end of execution (in addition to whatever logging you have setup in the functions themselves)
  - Execution will stop after all methods in the same parallel call return

If you have more complicated error behavior requirements, there's lots of ways to do this with vanilla javascript, such as setting and checking global state vars in your swigfile. And if for some reason you've concocted some really complex error scenarios that requires finer grained control and you want it wired directly up to series/parallel methods... well then there's always gulp.

## Typescript Notes

For a typescript swigfile.ts to work, you just need to install [`ts-node`](https://typestrong.org/ts-node/docs/) as a local dependency.

Note that I'm using the `-T` option under the hood to speed up execution ([`--transpileOnly`](https://typestrong.org/ts-node/docs/options#transpileonly)). There's valid reasons not to use this, but I generally rely on the IDE along with plugins like eslint plugins to find "compile-time" errors when I'm using ts-node in a dev situation rather than slowing down the execution with these type of checks. And if you don't use a good IDE for some reason, you'll still get some of the errors - you'll just see them at a slightly different spot in the execution process. But there are plenty of scenarios where this will let you shoot yourself in the foot, so just be aware if you're writing code in Notepad.exe or something. In the future I'd like to allow overriding swig's default ts-node config so this and other ts-node options can be changed.

If you don't want to install ts-node or just want to do your own transpilation, you can have 2 swigfiles in your directory and it'll pick the first one it finds, starting with the non-typescript versions. So if you have `swigfile.ts` file and maybe you have it automatically being transpiled to `swigfile.js`, then swig will pick up and use the `swigfile.js` version instead of using ts-node. Just don't forget to setup live watching of your swigfile if you're actively making changes and re-running it (such as with `tsc --watch` or whatever tool you're using).You wouldn't want to end up scratching your head because something isn't doing what you think it should, only because it doesn't have your latest changes.

## Recommended Usage

My recommendation is to install `swig-cli` as as global npm package (`npm i -g swig-cli`) because it will run much faster (no initial delay - see below), and you can type less. Also, if you use this on many projects like I do, you don't have to remember to add npm aliases to each project.

My opinion is that running stuff through npx and npm aliases is annoying because of the initial delay on each startup. For me this delay can be anywhere between 1 second and 4-8 seconds for some reason. That's not all that long, but it feels like an eternity when running a task that should only take a few milliseconds. This is why I prefer and recommend using a global install of `swig-cli` so you can call `swig` directly without incurring the startup delay.

If you choose to setup an npm alias anyway, you can create a simple alias that just points node to your local node_modules instance of swig:

```json
"scripts": {
  "swig": "swig"
}
```

And then call it with :

```bash
npm run swig yourTask
```

Or if you really like npm aliases and have lots of them and want to document each dev automation task in your package.json, you might alias individual tasks like this:

```json
"scripts": {
  "swig": "swig",
  "build": "swig build",
  "test": "swig test"
}
```

So that you can run stuff like this:

```bash
npm run build
npm run test
npm run swig someOtherTask
```

## Other Commands


Use the command `swig help` to see other available commands:

```
Usage: swig <command or taskName> [options]
Commands:
  <taskName> - Run a "task", which is an async function exported from your swigfile
    swig taskName
  list, ls, l - List available tasks (default)
    swig list
  help, h - Show help message
    swig help
  version, v - Print version number
    swig version
  filter, f - Filter and list tasks by name
    swig filter pattern
```

Note that these are essentially "reserved words". If you define exported tasks with these names in your swigfile, they'll never get run. The swig command will be run instead. Originally I was using dash params, but npm aliases and npx was causing them to be hijacked (for example, npx swig -v would output the npx version...). I've since changed my startup strategy and that may no longer be an issue, but I've left the commands as is for now.

Also note the `filter` command, which is handy if you have long list of commands and want to show only those with a particular substring (case insensitive). For example, list all tasks that have `db` in their names:

```bash
swig f db
```

### Disclaimers

- This package is pretty alpha. I've tested with several combinations of ESM, CommonJS and Typescript, but I've only tested with NodeJS 16 and 18.
- Unit tests haven't been added yet - I've only wired up some basic smoke tests for trying out different project/swigfile/syntax combos.
- Parallel is neat, but in practice JavaScript is still only single-threaded, so this will have more advantages in some scenarios than others. I have a dotnet prototype that is truly parallel/multi-threaded, so stay tuned for that if you have projects that could benefit from true multi-threaded processing.

## Dev Notes

If you'd like to make changes to the library or are just curious about my dev strategy, see [./docs/SwigDevNotes.md](./docs/SwigDevNotes.md).
